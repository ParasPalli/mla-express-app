# Pincode-Based API for MLA Data

This project implements a simple API that allows users to interact with MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) data through a pincode-based approach. The API accepts the pincode as a route parameter and returns a JSON object with relevant information. Additionally, users can send an object containing MLA data associated with a specific pincode, which will update the existing data.

## Current Limitations

At this stage, there is no comprehensive dataset available for the MLA information across India. The data for MLAs has to be web scraped from individual state websites to gather the required details. If you are interested in this data retrieval approach, feel free to reach out for further assistance.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Integration**: The API currently lacks a permanent storage solution. In the future, we can integrate MongoDB or any other suitable database to store and manage MLA data.
2. **Automated Data Scraping**: We aim to develop an automated web scraping mechanism to pull MLA data from state websites, enhancing the data retrieval process.

## How It Works

- The API expects a pincode as a route parameter.
- On receiving the pincode, the endpoint checks for the corresponding MLA data and returns it in JSON format.
- Users can also send an object containing MLA data associated with a pincode, which will be used to update the existing records.

## Future Plans

- Automate web scraping for MLA data retrieval.
- Integrate MongoDB or other databases for persistent storage.
